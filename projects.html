      <h3>LPG Gas Leakage Detection & Automatic Regulator Shut-Off</h3>
      <p>
        
      This project presents the design and implementation of a LPG gas leakage detection system with an automatic shutoff LPG gas regulator using an Arduino microcontroller.
      The primary objective of this system is to enhance safety in environments where LPG is used, such as residential homes, commercial kitchens, and industrial settings.<b>
      The system employs an MQ-2 gas sensor to detect the presence of LPG gas. Detection of a gas concentration exceeding a predefined threshold, the Arduino microcontroller which 
        in turn triggers an automatic shutoff mechanism in the LPG gas regulator, effectively cutting off the gas supply to prevent further leakage. 
      Additionally, the system includes audible alarms to alert occupants about the gas leakage. <b>
     This integration of gas detection and automatic shutoff mechanisms significantly reduces the risk of fire and explosion, ensuring the safety of individuals and property. 
    The proposed system is cost-effective, easy to implement, and provides a reliable solution for preventing accidents related to LPG gas leaks. 
        The paper also discusses the calibration of the gas sensor, system design considerations, and potential applications in various settings.

      <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java)</h3>
      <p>
        Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that two people can enjoy together. It is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their marks, X or O, in empty spots. 
        The main goal is to get three of the same marks in a row-horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
